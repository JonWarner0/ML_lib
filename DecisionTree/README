1. Execute with: 
	
	./run.sh		# Runs all three required instances with all required depths.
	
	---For Individual Runs---
	./run_car.txt 		# Runs the car dataset, depths 1-6.
	./run_bank.txt		# Runs the bank dataset with numeric median, depths 1-16.

	python3 ID3.py <trainfile> <testfile> <depth> <flag>

Flag Options:
	'-num'   :  For numeric values to split based on median.
	'-unkn'  :  Same as '-num' but with replacement of 'unkown' values.
