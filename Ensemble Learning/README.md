# Run the run.sh to execute all algorithms. Decision tree based algorithms run from 1-500 in steps of 50.
# Run the runBaisVariance.sh to execute the Bias + Variance decomposition for bagging and random forest. (They do have an very long run time)
# Remaining .sh files are runable files for the respective algorithms except for the gradient descent algorithms; they can be run in the following format 'python3 BatchGD.py <trainging> <testing>'
