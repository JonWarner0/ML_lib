# Ensemble Algorithms

Run the run.sh to execute all algorithms. Decision tree based algorithms run from 1-500 in steps of 50.

Run the runBaisVariance.sh to execute the Bias + Variance decomposition for bagging and random forest. (They do have an very long run time)

Remaining .sh files are runable files for the respective algorithms
